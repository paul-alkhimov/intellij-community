# Proposal 1
In order to ease the usage of the Project View, let's encode the semantics in color so that user wouldn't have to parse the text.  

![Proof of concept: syntactically colored members in treeView](/description-of-changes/POC-IDEA-2018-03-12.png)

## PROs
:+1: Reduction of cognitive load, no need to search the elements of the line  
:+1: Streamlined the presentation by making it same as in the code
## CONs
:-1: Implementation increases the code complexity (if it were a matter of config, then there would be no drawbacks).
