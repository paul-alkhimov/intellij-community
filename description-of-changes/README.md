# Proposal 1
In order to ease the usage of the Project View, let's encode the semantics in color so that user wouldn't have to parse the text.  

![Proof of concept: syntactically colored members in treeView](/description-of-changes/POC-IDEA-2018-03-12.png)

## PROs
* Reduction of cognitive load by removing the need to parse the line  
* Reduction of cognitive load by making the representation of members same as in the code  
## CONs
* Names are not aligned anymore
* Implementation increases the code complexity (if it were a matter of config, then there would be no drawbacks).
